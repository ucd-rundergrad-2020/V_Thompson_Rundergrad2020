### Week 6 exercises

##### Dull560 LUC data set  
Graph time and luminescence for each genotype  
* Make sure data is formatted properly  
* Calculate the average luminescence of each genotype at each time point  
* Scale luminescence of all genotypes  
  + Universal background subtraction so trough values are close to 0 (subtract the same thing from all genotypes)  
  + Within each genotype, scale luminescence from 1 to 0 (so the peak = 1)  
  + Try this using *grouped functions* (grouped mutates/summaries)  
  + Also try this using *mapping loops* (from purrr) for comparison (or for loops if youâ€™d prefer)  
* Make your graph - think about aesthetics  
* Optional: calculate standard error of luminescence of each genotype at each time point and use that to create error bars
